This repository was created to host the files in a Computer Vision project.

This project is still in development.

This is a part of a Masterclass in Computer Vision lectured by Carlos Melo, Data Scientist and Owner of Sigmoidal.ai.

In this project, the goal is to work with image manipulation, creating filters that can be used to manipulate images uploaded by users.

Future uploads will include:
- English Version
- More Filters
- Deployment
